```{ssh, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
Host github
HostName github.com
        User git
        PreferredAuthentications publicly
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/mykeys

```

*** 
If you love ssh and auomation you're probably has a custom ssh_config file that hold your screets files. But then you need to integrate github as well which may look like this

```{ssh, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
git clone git@github.com:poidstotal/sh

```

Then error happen
```{ssh, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
git clone git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
Cloning into 'myrepo'...
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

a quick solution is to first run make sure you can ssh to other server. and then you ssh to github as well. 

```{ssh, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
ssh github.com

```


#### The Problem (You can skip it)
But then wehn you try to clone or connect to your repo, you receive
```{ssh, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,results='asis'}
git push origin master

```


#### Initial solution
